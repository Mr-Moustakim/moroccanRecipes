    <p>Tajine is a North African dish named after the earthenware pot in which it is cooked.<br>It is also called a
        Maraq/marqa in North Africa and the Middle East.<br>The traditional tajine pot is formed entirely of a heavy
        clay which is sometimes painted or glazed.<br>It consists of two parts: a base unit that is flat and circular
        with low sides and a large cone or dome-shaped cover that rests inside the base during cooking.</p>

    <h3>How to make Moroccan Tajine</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the oil and onions to a pot over medium-high heat and sauté until slightly softened (around 3 minutes).
            Add the garlic and ginger and sauté for another minute. Now add the spices: paprika, coriander, cumin,
            cinnamon, cardamom, black pepper, turmeric, fennel, and oregano and sauté for 10 seconds to bloom the
            spices. Immediately add the tomato, water, salt, preserved lemon, and bay leaf. Scoop out half of this
            spiced tomato mixture into a small bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Remove the pot from the heat until you put in your veggies. You can arrange them nicely or just dump them
            all in, whichever you prefer! Either way, add the potatoes, carrots, zucchinis, and chile, then pour the
            reserved half of the spiced tomato mixture over the veggies. Put it back on medium-high heat, cover the pot,
            and let it boil for 2-3 minutes. Now reduce the heat to low and leave it to simmer, completely covered, for
            20 minutes.</li>
        <li>After twenty minutes, scatter in the olives and dried cherries. Cover again and continue to simmer for
            another 5-10 minutes. After 5 minutes, check the doneness of the hardest vegetable you used---in this case,
            it's the potatoes. If they aren't done yet, give them that extra 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the veggies are all cooked, taste the sauce for seasoning and adjust the salt if needed. Sprinkle with
            the cilantro, a squirt of lemon, and an extra drizzle of olive oil if you like. Serve immediately with bread
            or couscous or brown rice.</li>
